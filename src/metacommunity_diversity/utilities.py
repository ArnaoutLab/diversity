    Parameters
    ----------
    order:
        Exponent used for the power mean.
    weights:
        The weights corresponding to items. Must be 1-d or 2-d. If 2-d,
        each column must contain at least one weight whose absolute
        value is greater than or equal to atol.

        The elements for which the weighted power mean is computed. Must
        have same shape as weights.
    atol:
        Threshold below which weights are considered to be 0.

    Returns
    -------
    A numpy.ndarray of the power means of items along axis 0 using order
    as exponent, weighted by weights. The array shape is the same as
    that of weights, or items except with the 0-axis removed. In the
    case of 1-d weights and items, the result has shape (1,). When order
    is close to 0 (absolute value less than atol), less than -100, or
    greater than 100 analytical formulas for the limits at 0, -infinity,
    or infinity are used respectively. An exception is raised if all weights
    in a column are close to 0.

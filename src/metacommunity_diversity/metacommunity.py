        ----------

            2-d array with one column per subcommunity, one row per

            corresponding subcommunities.
        similarity:
            For similarity-sensitive diversity measures. Use DataFrame
            or ndarray if the similarity matrix fits in memory. Use a
            numpy memmap or a filepath if the similarity matrix fits on
            the hard drive disk. Use a Callable function if the
            similarity matrix does not fit on the disk.

            An array, where each pair of rows will be passed to

        chunk_size:
            The number of file lines to process at a time when the
            similarity matrix is read from a file. Larger chunk sizes

pip install diversity
```


# Usage and Examples

```python
from diversity.metacommunity import make_metacommunity
import pandas as pd
```

## Similarity-sensitive diversity from a dataframe or array

This example uses aggregated data from the [Palmer penguins dataset](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins). The first input is a subcommunity-by-species counts table.

```python
counts = pd.DataFrame(
    {
      "Biscoe":    [44, 0, 120], 
      "Dream":     [55, 68, 0], 
      "Torgersen": [47, 0, 0]
    },
    index=["Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo"],
)
```

|           | Biscoe | Dream | Torgersen |
| :-------- | -----: | ----: | --------: |
| Adelie    |     44 |    55 |        47 |
| Chinstrap |      0 |    68 |         0 |
| Gentoo    |    120 |     0 |         0 |

We include an index with the species names here for illustrative purposes, but in general, an index is not require for the counts or similiarty matrix.

Next, we create a species similiarty matrix.

```python
similarity_matrix = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "Adelie":    [1.000000, 0.347385, 0.222998],
        "Chinstrap": [0.347385, 1.000000, 0.258256],
        "Gentoo":    [0.222998, 0.258256, 1.000000],
    },
    index=["Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo"],
)
```

|           |   Adelie | Chinstrap |   Gentoo |
| :-------- | -------: | --------: | -------: |
| Adelie    |        1 |  0.347385 | 0.222998 |
| Chinstrap | 0.347385 |         1 | 0.258256 |
| Gentoo    | 0.222998 |  0.258256 |        1 |

Finally, we create a Metacommunity object from the counts and similarity matrix.

```python
metacommunity = make_metacommunity(counts, similarity=similarity_matrix)
```

Metacommunty objects have convenience functions for calculating all diviersty measures for each subcommunity for a given viewpoint.

```python
metacommunity.subcommunities_to_dataframe(viewpoint=0)
```

|      | community | viewpoint | alpha |  rho | beta | gamma | normalized_alpha | normalized_rho | normalized_beta |
| ---: | :-------- | --------: | ----: | ---: | ---: | ----: | ---------------: | -------------: | --------------: |
|    0 | Biscoe    |         0 |  3.15 | 1.70 | 0.59 |  1.89 |             1.55 |           0.84 |            1.20 |
|    1 | Dream     |         0 |  4.02 | 2.07 | 0.48 |  1.99 |             1.48 |           0.76 |            1.31 |
|    2 | Torgersen |         0 |  7.11 | 4.18 | 0.24 |  1.70 |             1.00 |           0.59 |            1.70 |


We can also compute all metacommunity measures at once. 
```python
metacommunity.subcommunities_to_dataframe(viewpoint=0)
```

|      | community     | viewpoint | alpha |  rho | beta | gamma | normalized_alpha | normalized_rho | normalized_beta |
| ---: | :------------ | --------: | ----: | ---: | ---: | ----: | ---------------: | -------------: | --------------: |
|    0 | metacommunity |         0 |  4.03 | 2.19 | 0.50 |  1.90 |             1.45 |           0.77 |            1.31 |



It is also possible to calculate individual diversity measures for subcommunities:

```python
metacommunity.subcommunity_diversity(viewpoint=2, measure='alpha')
array([2.93063044, 4.00900135, 7.10638298])
```

And equivalently for the metacommunity:

```python
metacommunity.metacommunity_diversity(viewpoint=2, measure='beta')
0.48236433045721444
```
    

## Similarity-sensitive diversity from a file

For large datasets, the similarity matrix may not fit in RAM. To avoid loading the entire matrix into RAM, you can pass a filepath to the `similarity` argument to read a file from a hard disk drive.


```python
metacommunity = make_metacommunity(counts, similarity='similarity_matrix.csv')
```

## Similarity-insensitive indices

If you wish to construct a metacommunity without similarity, simply pass the counts table to `make_metacommunity`.

```python
metacommunity = make_metacommunity(counts)
```


## Command line interface

`diversity` can also be used from the command-line as a module (via `python -m`).

The example below uses the `penguin_counts.csv` and `penguin_similarity_matrix.csv` files, which can be downloaded from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/Elliot-D-Hill/f6e9db0aebe561a363e8758c72a0acfc).

Once the files are downloaded, execute

```bash
python -m diversity -i penguin_counts.csv -s penguin_similarity_matrix.csv -v 0 1 inf
```

to obtain all subcommunity diversity measures for the viewpoint
parameter values 0, 1, and infinity:

|      | community     | viewpoint |  alpha |    rho |   beta |  gamma | normalized_alpha | normalized_rho | normalized_beta |

- for further options execute `python -m diversity -h`


# Background


## Diversity indices

A ***community*** is a collection of elements called ***individuals***, each of which is assigned a label called its ***species***, where multiple individuals may have the same species. A ***diversity index*** is a statistic associated with a community, which describes how much the species of its individuals vary. For example, a community of many individuals of the same species has a very low diversity whereas a community with multiple species and the same amount of individuals per species has a high diversity.


## Partitioned diversity

Some diversity indices compare the diversities of subsets of a community with respect to the overall community. The subsets are called ***subcommunities***, while the overall community is called a ***metacommunity***. For example, two communities with the same frequency distribution across two disjoint sets of the same number of unique species each comprise half of the combined metacommunity diversity. Examples of interpretations of some of these diversity indices include: the "representativeness" of a subcommunity of its metacommunity, and the "contribution" of a subcommunity to its metacommunity's diversity. 


## Frequency-sensitive diversity

[In 1973, Hill introduced a framework](https://doi.org/10.2307/1934352) which unifies commonly used diversity indices into a single parameterized family of diversity measures. The so-called ***viewpoint parameter*** can be thought of as the sensitivity to rare species. At one end of the spectrum, when the viewpoint parameter is set to 0, species frequency is ignored entirely, and only the number of distinct species matters, while at the other end of the spectrum, when the viewpoint parameter is set to âˆž, only the highest frequency species in a community is considered by the corresponding diversity measure. Common diversity measures such as ***species richness***, ***Shannon entropy***, the ***Gini-Simpson index***, and the ***Berger-Parker index*** have simple and natural relationships with Hill's indices at different values for the viewpoint parameter (0, 1, 2, âˆž, respectively).


## Similarity-sensitive diversity

In addition to being sensitive to frequency, it often makes sense to account for similarity in a diversity measure. For example, a community of 2 different types of rodents, may be considered less diverse as the same community where one of the rodent types was replaced by the same number of individuals of a bird species. [Reeve et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6520) and [Leinster and Cobbold](https://doi.org/10.1890/10-2402.1) present a general mathematically rigorous way of incorporating similarity measures into Hill's framework. The result is a family of similarity-sensitive diversity indices parameterized by the same viewpoint parameter as well as the similarity function used for the species in the meta- or subcommunities of interest. As opposed to accounting for distinct species and their frequency, these similarity-sensitive diversity measures can be interpreted as accounting for different possibly overlapping clusters of mutually similar species and their combined frequencies.


## One package to calculate them all

The `diversity` package is able to calculate all of the similarity- and frequency-sensitive subcommunity and metacommunity diversity measures described in [Reeve et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6520). See the paper for more in-depth information on their derivation and interpretation.

## Alternatives

Diversity can be defined in various ways and software calculating the various diversity measures exists. To date, we know of no other python package that implements the similarity-sensitive partitioned diversity measures defined by [Reeve at al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6520). An [R package](https://github.com/boydorr/rdiversity) and a [julia package](https://github.com/EcoJulia/Diversity.jl) exist. However, both packages require the species similarities to be stored in the form of a matrix in memory. That approach does not scale to the amount of species in some applications, such as immune repertoires. `diversity` allows the user to store the similarity matrix in a file allowing for larger datasets to be analyzed.
